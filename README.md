This repository contains code for animation within the python arcade program.  I have added comments on many lines of code to explain what they are and what they do to my understanding.  I think I am most confused on what function abbreviations mean and also what they do.  This is on me to study more and discover and memorize what they mean. I am working my hardest to figure it out and it honestly really interests me though! First class I have had in a while that I enjoy learning it even though I am terrible at it haha.
